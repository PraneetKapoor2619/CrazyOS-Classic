# CrazyOS - 8086  
  
This directory contains the real-mode version of CrazyOS. This was my major project undertaken during the final semester of my undergrad in B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am the sole author of this project.  
  
You need to have qemu, NASM, and GCC installed to build and run the operating system. The operating system is built by issuing `make build` command in a terminal. To run the image in build folder, issue `make run` command. To remove binaries from the build folder, issue `make clean` command.  
  
To understand this project, you can go through the [major project report](Report/Report.pdf). It has been completely written by me. Everybody else's name on the report is just a formality because hey! it is a team project!

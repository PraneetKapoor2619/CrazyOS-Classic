Description of Important Functions in ttyio
===========================================

A terminal emulator, or terminal for short, emulates old teletypewriters. It
takes in some input from keys and then gives out some output on the screen
(instead of a paper roll). 
To build a good terminal emulator we require some standard functions for i/o
processing, which can be used not only by the main body of the tty, but also
by other applications which might be running. That's why some standard 
functions are implemented here. They can be used in building a program by 
a) including ttyio.inc file 
b) linking the object file of the program with ttyio.o file during the 
linking process.

Here I have described a primitive "token of information exchange", these
functions are using.

The first and the only major point to be noted is that information is
exchanged through ax register i.e., it is the carrier pigeon. 
Say you wish to call a function in ttyio library. The argument for the same 
should be stored in the ax register before calling the function. 

EXAMPLE:
	mov ax, 0x1234		; store 0x1234 in ax 
	call printhex		; print the value in ax as a hex number

The value returned by a function is stored in ax.

EXAMPLE:
	call getchar		; getchar returns the keyboard scan code
				; and the ascii character recorded after
				; a keystroke

The diagram below will make all this a bit easier to understand:

	         caller:------->ax
		    ^		|
		    |		|
		    |		|
		    |		v
		    |	     function
		    |	        |
		    |		|
		    |		|
		    |		|
		    |		V
		    <----------ax

NOTE: Here output = return value of the function

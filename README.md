# CrazyOS 
## An operating system made because it's fun  
  
Developing my own operating system is a project that I wanted to do as a kid. Now, with the half-cooked knowledge that I have, I think I can make one. Too many people have already made clones of UNIX, so I am not going to do that. I will just implement some basic libraries, play with the tools I have and hope that it evolves into something worth using. Furthermore, I plan on writing the entire operating system in assembly language of specific architecture. Writing programs in assembly language is something which is frowned upon by the folks on the Internet. My choices clearly indicate that I am a crazy person. Hence the name _Crazy_ OS.  
  
As one would have guessed it by now, this operating system would not be portable (maybe in the future, but with a one-man army, I don't think portability is conceivable).
I am aiming at making this operating system work on:
1. IBM PC with 8086, or real-mode in i386 based IBM PC
3. x86-64 (long mode)  
4. ARM (Raspberry Pi)  
5. RISC-V
